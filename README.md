🌍 World Important Events – Ancient to Modern

A data-driven exploration of global historical events with sentiment analysis and predictive modeling

📌 Introduction

This project investigates a curated dataset of world historical events, spanning from ancient civilizations to the modern era. It applies data exploration, visualization, sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling techniques to uncover patterns and insights.

The objective is to demonstrate how informatics and data science can transform descriptive, text-rich datasets into meaningful analyses, highlighting historical trends and their broader implications.

📂 Dataset

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes structured information about significant world events with attributes such as:

Country – geographical location of the event

Affected Population – number of individuals impacted

Total Population – reference population size

Text Description – narrative details of the event

Additional metadata for categorization and analysis

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Standardized numeric and categorical fields

Derived new features such as Impact Score, Century, and Era

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Frequency of events across countries and categories

Identification of historically active regions and time periods

Visualization of narratives using word clouds

Feature Engineering

Computed an Impact Score to quantify event magnitude

Applied sentiment analysis to text descriptions

Predictive Modeling

Built baseline machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)

Evaluated predictive capacity using accuracy and performance metrics

📈 Results

Highlighted the most eventful countries and centuries throughout history

Generated a word cloud emphasizing frequent historical terms and themes

Developed an Impact Score to represent the proportional effect of events

Applied sentiment analysis to assess polarity of event narratives

Conducted preliminary predictive modeling for classification tasks

🚀 Future Work

Replace placeholder outcomes with authentic classification labels such as event severity or type

Enhance analysis with interactive dashboards in Tableau, Power BI, or Plotly

Apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including topic modeling and transformer-based models

Integrate geospatial visualizations to map events across regions and eras
